                        Lee Sedol, the Go world champion, who has recently lost 4-1 against AlphaGo, a Google Deepmind program built in London.
                        Go is a very complex game - its board is 19x19 - and has a branching factor much larger than chess. After Deep Blue beat Kasparov 3.5-2.5 at chess in 1997, go became the next challenge for game-playing AIs.
                        AlphaGo is not a program that could be written by a human and a keyboard; it was built with current state-of-the-art machine learning (and buzzword): deep learning. What does that mean? We have to rewind time a bit to fully understand it.

                        We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.

                        One of the advances that came out of those years (1957) was the perceptron. It's inspired by what was known about human neurons at the time: they fire once they reach their activation potential, as non-linear systems.
                        The perceptron tries to reproduce a function of many variables. The inputs are real numbers, and they are linearly combined with constants called weights, multiplied to each of them. `f` is called activation function and it's the non-linearity, in the case of the perceptron it's a simple step function that is 1 when its input is positive and 0 when its input is negative. Later it was changed to a sigmoid (1 / (1 - e^-t)) because it's differentiable

                        To use a perceptron in practice, we need to find what its weigths should be. For this, we use a training set: lots of examples of the function we want to mimic. Given a large enough training set, we hope to learn good values for the weights that will generalize to new inputs not in the training set.
                        Given some values for the weights, we can calculate for each example an output y which is close (or not) to ŷ, and an error equal to the difference between the two.
                        This is an AND function: only 1 when both inputs are 1. Not represented here is an x<sub>0</sub> term for each example called bias, which is always 1: it gives a constant term to the linear combination.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        When we start from a random set of weights, we want to understand how we should modify those weights when we are shown a new example, complete with input and expected output. If what we see here is an error function like (ŷ - y), w<sub>0</sub> will place the output in some place of the curve, usually not when this error is minimum. For example, if AND(1, 1) is 0.4 the error is 0.6. If we compute the derivative of the error function, we find that:
                        - it's 0 in the minimum
                        - it's positive if we have offshoot a minimum
                        - it's negative if we are before a minimum
                        Therefore the derivative of the error with respect to a weight is an indication of how we should update the weight:
                        - do nothing if we are in a minimum, anything will worsen the error
                        - subtract something off the weight if we are to the right of a minimum
                        - add something to the weight if we are to the left of a minimum
                        These are all local minima!

                        Suppose we want to learn from one example at a time, showing them in sequence to our perceptron.
                        We compute the actual value the perceptron is calculating, which will probably be off. Then we calculate the error. A positive error means a shortfall, so a negative derivative.
                        We update the weight with a term proportional to the derivative, which is just e * x<sub>i</sub> (simplification, learning rules can be more complex depending on the activation step)

                        Fortunately, we can build an actual neural network by feeding the output of a perceptron as the input of another. These structures are commonly separated into layers (at least in non-recurrent neural network): one input layer, one or many hidden layers, one output layer.
                        To traing this network we use a generalization of the perceptron learning rule, called backpropagation, in which at each iteration we first update the weights of the output layer, than the ones of the preceding layer, and so on; each layer using the weights of the next layer as input. Theorems say that a network with 1 hidden layer can approximate any real function of real variables, so we stick to 1 hidden layer, why making it more complex?

                       Here we see a convolutional neural network for the recognition of hand-written digits, one of the standard problems against which new approaches and models are measured. The pixels of a 32x32 image of the digit have a luminance value from 0 to 1. They are connected to the input layer, which is not fully-connected but is a convolution, a mathematical operation that makes each neuron of the next layer the combination of a (5x5) square pixel around its position.
                       The next layer is a subsampling layer, which divides the previous layer in 2x2 squares and takes the maximum (or another function) in the set of the convolutional neuron values. More layers are added on top... until we get to the output layer, consisting of 10 neurons corresponding to the different classes, the 10 digits from 0 to 9. The maximum value wins as the input image is classified into that set.
