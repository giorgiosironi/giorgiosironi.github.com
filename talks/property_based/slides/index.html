                            Also known as Arrange-Act-Assert in pre-BDD era, automated testing nowadays starts from an initial conditions, exercises the System Under Test and performs checks over the output, or the state, or the history of the System.

                            An example start from a known input decided and written down by the programmer. It performs some actions over the System Under Test, and executes a check over the output comparing it to an expected output that is a big part of the example.

                            Every discrete-time stateful system can be viewed as a pure function that takes the current state and a new input to produce the next state and an output. Therefore when I talk about input/output there is no loss of generality towards stateful systems. This is a notion that comes from sequential circuits, as a proof of its ubiquity.

                            There are many issues with testing only with examples, even when using a test-first and test-driven approach. TDD is a design tool that gives us feedback on the design but it's not a complete solution to testing over complicated systems.
                            Let's choose to add many examples to raise not only the code coverage but also the coverage of possible inputs that could break our system, and of the combinatorial paths that they can take inside the system.
                            Notwithstanding the time taken to write all these tests, how do we maintain it when some specification changes?
                            Moreover, how do we choose unusual combination of inputs? There are many cases we don't even think about.

                            In property-based testing we cannot test for all inputs, so we take a large random sample of possible input and generate one test for each of them. After exercising the System Under Test, we verify properties that should always be true no matter the input.

                            This time we build a test by generating a random sequence of prices, where each element of the list can be an instance of SingleAmount and ContinuousRangeOfAmounts. The sequence has a random number of elements too. After we have added all the elements to the set, we can check that each of them is still contained - an invariant property that will always be true no matter the input, given a correct implementation. We are testing that our aggressive optimizations that try to store the smallest representation for the set do not lose information.
                            We can think of many other properties here: when it grows, the set must always contain any value that it was containing before. After each iteration, the minimum of the set should be less than or equal to the maximum. No matter the order in which we add a given sequence of prices to the set, the end result should always be the same.

                            You do not just cover more inputs but can also execute wildly different paths inside the code depending on them. The sample is more uniform than "the next tests that come to mind". You write a single test but can execute it hundreds of times with different inputs at no cost. Finally, properties improve on TDD feedback by giving you insight on the specification and may lead you to discover inconsistent requirements or counterexamples that break the assumptions you were making.

                            Of course, you get the help of the machine in generating all those tests. Property-based tests are no good for documentation, but they move towards the proof-side of the spectrum. They start from something that worked (examples) and try to build on them to get a more comprehensive coverage. You can't do full combinatorial testing, or cover all inputs like in a proof; but proofs only worked in limited contexts anyway...

                            When a randomized input produces a test failure, it is then simplified to run the test again and again until the new input causes the test to pass. The goal of this <em>shrinking</em> process is to produce the simplest input that causes a failing test instead of a purely random failure, and to possibly make the discovered bug obvious. In the example, we immediately discovered the problem was related to leap years and February 29th even if the first input that caused the test to fail was probably something like the pair January 25th-August 19th.

                            How I went about testing image manipulation code such as resizing: painfully generating and maintaining reference images to use as input and expected output.
                            How I go now: use inverse operations such as resizing by 200% and 50% to avoid having to maintain expected outputs but only using the input itself as a reference.

                            This was one of the bugs in the PHP DateTime library that we found with property-based testing. In certain conditions such as the UTC timezone, adding a number of days to a data that passes over February 29th results in a off-by-one error as one day is skipped or added. By testing our UTCDateTime class that delegates to the language's DateTime we found the bug and inserted a work around.
                            In *TDD* you often say "you don't test the language + operator", but with your *testing* hat you may.
