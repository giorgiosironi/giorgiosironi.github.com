          Onebip is a payment provider that takes money from your SIM card and uses it to pay for digital goods. There are hundreds of mobile phone operators to integrate with. Different people may work on each system. I'm ignoring reporting here and concentrate on the transactional part: what is needed to perform a payment.

      <aside class="notes">
          Test suites support multiple goals, like safety (I deploy and don't break what was working before), but also change (refactoring with a safety net) and documentation (readability of steps and avoiding writing tens of thousands of lines of test code.

      So I'm showing here how to write effective and fast end-to-end tests, but I'm saying at the same time that unit tests are just as important. Just easier to write, so here's some advice on the end-to-end ones.

    <aside class="notes">
    It's not as simple as mocking, as simulators need to be backed by an actual database as their code may run in many different processes and servers. Don't make the mistake of going for "as simple as possible" solutions like writing on files as they will get crazy with race conditions.

      <h2><a href="http://natpryce.com/articles/000780.html">TDD at the System Scale</a></h2>
      If you can't test results through the API (need to look into the database directly for results), 
      you're missing a way to monitor and drive the real system.
    <aside class="notes">
        Surprise, not only unit test drive design forcing low coupling and cohesion of objects; also end-to-end tests drive the design of a self-sufficient, complete and concurrent API.

    Separate automation from specification, which is one thing that Cucumber-style frameworks force you to do. Also you cannot write much data inside Gherkin as it's not a structured format, so you have to select the most relevant, provide sensible defaults and make the job of the users of your system easier by asking them to fill in only what is written here (no 10-page form).

    Read high level logs to find out which interactions are
    (another example of system TDD driving you towards better auditing)
    Once found out the problem, reproduce them reliably by inserting sleep() that exacerbate the problem in the right place
    Sometimes you need support from people from multiple projects to find out the culprit

      <h2>Discovery: our applications support concurrency</h2>
      <img src="images/concurrency.jpg" style="height: 600px;" alt="Users in production environment" />
  <aside class="notes">
      The tests can be designed so that they are isolated from each other, following the boundaries of the Aggregates (Domain-Driven Design jargon) in the system. For example, use different randomly-generated phone numbers for each test, and only assert things that happen to that user such as <em>their</em> credit being affected by the payment and <em>their</em> subscription to a magazine being now active.
      Also, any test should be able to run no matter what is the state of the database, so that large batches of setup and teardown operation are not necessary.

      <aside class="notes">
          Concurrency enables parallelism: if the tests are isolated from each other, you can run them in parallel. Specify a fixed process pool in order not to overload the system (here 2 processes per CPU.)
